## Requirements

This repo is part of the final project for EC Utbildning Code Patterns Course.

This project is divided into two different projects.

FRONTEND [This repo]()

This can be a frontend application done in React, Vue, ASP.NET Core MVC or Blazor. You can pick your preferred development environment. The important part of the exercise isn't to pick a framework, but to have a tool to approach this exercise with. In this exam you got a design file as a basis for the functionality that should be represented for each grading level. It doesn't matter if you follow the design file 100%.

BACKEND [Find the repo here](https://github.com/simonekranawetter/CodePatternsBackend)

Depending on what framework you pick for frontend you need a backend to use as well. If you pick MVC you don't need to seperate your backend, but if you don't you need to use ASP.NET Core Web Api. Your backend solution should even have a connection to a storage solution. That storage solution can be a NoSql or SQL solution of your choice. You can pick what is best suited for your needs.

<u>For the good grade</u>

- Frontend should be able to list products accoding to what is visible on the first page of the design and have a connection to backend
- Backend should have the design principle following MVC or MVVM
- Backend code should follow Single Responsibility Principle. Comment code and motivate your use of SRP
- Backend code should follow Open-Closed Principle. Comment code and motivate your use
- Backend code should follow Liskov Substitution Principle. Comment code and motivate your use
- Backend code should follow Interface Segregation Principle. Comment code and motivate your use
- Backend code should follow Dependency Inversion Principle. Comment code and motivate your use
